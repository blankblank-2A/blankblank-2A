### 🧠 About Me  
I’m developing **Balkava OS**, a Termux-based operating system coded and tested entirely inside Termux.  
My focus is on **realistic system components**, **bootloader simulations**, and building tools that mimic the behavior of **modern embedded platforms**.

### 🔭 Current Projects  
- **Balkava OS**: Core system design and simulation *(currently under heavy development)*  
- **bapt**: Package manager for Balkava applications  

---

### 🎲 Fun Fact  
The name **Balkava** came from a misspelling of *baklava*, I misread it once and it became the project’s name forever.  

---

### 🛠 Technical Skills  
- **Languages:** C, C++, Go, Shell  
- **Tools & Environments:** Termux (on my Redmi 12C), Git, Linux (various distros via `Termux proot-distro`)  
- **Domains of Interest:** Operating systems, compilers, system recovery, embedded platforms  

---

### 🎯 Goals  
- Expand **Balkava OS** into a feature-complete simulated environment  
- Explore **cross-language development** for system-level tools  
- Continue diving deeper into **low-level systems programming** and OS design
