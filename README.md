# Hi, I'm Justine ðŸ‘‹

I am developing **Balkava OS**, a Termux-based operating system (coded and tested inside Termux) that integrates concepts from both Android and Linux.  
My focus is on building realistic system components, experimenting with bootloader simulations, and designing tools that replicate the behavior of modern embedded platforms.

---

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Balkava OS** â€“ Core system design and simulation  
- **bapt** â€“ A package manager for Balkava applications  

---

## ðŸŽ² Fun Fact
The name **Balkava** comes from a misspelling of *baklava* â€” I accidentally misread it, and it stuck.  

---

## ðŸ›  Technical Skills
- **Languages:** C, C++, Go, Shell  
- **Tools & Environments:** Termux(at my redmi 12c), Git, Linux (various distributions inside of Termux proot-distro)  
- **Domains of Interest:** Operating systems, compilers, system recovery, embedded platforms  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Extend Balkava OS into a feature-complete environment with realistic simulations  
- Explore cross-language development of system software  
- Continue deepening expertise in low-level systems programming and OS design
